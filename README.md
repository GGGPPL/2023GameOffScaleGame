# 2023GameOffScaleGame --- J the slime

**J the slime**, a vertical platformer developed for the ***2023 GitHub Game Off jam***. You control a juicy slime with the unique ability to absorb juice to scale up, and lose some juice to jump.

### BUT, BE CAREFUL,

it takes a lot of jumps to go up, but one failure is enough for you to fall to the start.

## Game Concept

- **Player Character**: A slime-like creature that can:
  - **Jump & Shrink**:

        some juice are splashed whenever you jump
  - **Grow**:

        collect juice from juice puddles or the juice you left to grow the slime

- that's all, try and jump your way through to the end.
